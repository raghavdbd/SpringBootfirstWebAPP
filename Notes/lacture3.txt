In this we learn About Params

 public String loginpage(@RequestParam String name,ModelMap model){
        model.put("name",name);
        return "Loginpage";
    }


    @RequestParam -> this annotation is usedto define param 
    model-> Whenever we want to pass something from controller to jsp this we do by putting them in model

    if we want to access param value in jsp then we use
    ${name}

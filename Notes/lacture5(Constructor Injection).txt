Constructor injection is a form of dependency injection in which dependencies
 (usually other objects or services) are provided to a class through its constructor. 
 In simpler terms, when you create an instance of a class, the required dependencies
  are "injected" into the class by passing them as arguments to the constructor. 
  Constructor injection is one of the common ways to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) in object-oriented programming.


  The @Service annotation is one of the stereotype annotations provided by the Spring Framework. 
  It is used to declare a class as a service component in a Spring-based application.
   Services in Spring typically represent the business logic and services that your application provides.
    When you mark a class with @Service, it becomes a Spring-managed bean, and Spring takes care of its lifecycle and dependency injection.
